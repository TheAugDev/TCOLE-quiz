                                   <li>Sexual assault is a hostile act of control, domination, and humiliation, not sexual desire.</li>
                                   <li>**Consent** means "assent in fact, whether expressed or apparent." It must be knowing and voluntary.</li>
                                   <li>**It is NOT consent if:** A sexual act is accomplished through coercion, force, or threats; the victim is silent; the victim is unconscious, physically unable to resist, or lacks mental capacity; or the victim is intoxicated and unaware. Any sexual act with a victim under 17 is nonconsensual by law (subject to affirmative defenses).</li>

                                   <li>Fear of facing the offender again (at school, work, etc.).</li>

                                   <li>During a traumatic event, a flood of hormones (like cortisol and adrenaline) is released to help the person survive.</li>
                                   <li>These hormones impact demeanor, causing a wide range of reactions: apathy, crying, laughter, anger, or appearing frozen/dazed. **There is no "correct" reaction.**</li>
                                   <li>These same hormones disrupt how memories are stored, causing them to be fragmented and non-linear. A survivor may recall sensory details (a smell, the ceiling) vividly but not the sequence of events.</li>
                                   <li>A sexual response (arousal, orgasm) can be an involuntary physiological reaction and **does not indicate consent**.</li>

                                <p>"If a man applies pressure to a woman's neck one time in an intimate relationship, she is <strong>750% more likely</strong> to later be killed by him."</p>

                                    <li>**Use Verbatim Quotes:** Use the victim's and suspect's exact words in quotation marks. Do not "clean up" or sanitize the language.</li>
                                    <li>**Use Non-Consensual Language:** Describe the act with objective, forceful language (e.g., "he forced his penis into her vagina") rather than consensual terms ("they had sex").</li>
                                    <li>**Document Lack of Consent:** "No" is communicated in many ways. Document actions like looking away, closing eyes, or physical resistance. If they couldn't resist, document what prevented them.</li>
                                    <li>**Be Specific About Force:** Instead of "he threatened me," document the specific threats, tone of voice, and gestures.</li>
                                    <li>**Do Not Fill Gaps:** If a victim's memory is fragmented, document it as such. Do not guess or fill in missing details.</li>
