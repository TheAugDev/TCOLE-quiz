                answer: "Over 10 times more likely",

                explanation: "The key element that elevates Unlawful Restraint to Kidnapping is 'abduction,' which means to restrain a person with the intent to prevent their liberation by secreting them, or by using or threatening to use deadly force.",

                answer: "The actor was a relative of the person abducted and their sole intent was to assume lawful control.",
                explanation: "PC 20.03 provides this affirmative defense for parental abduction-type scenarios, but it requires that the actor was a relative and only intended to assume lawful control, without the intent to use deadly force.",

                answer: "All of the above.",
                explanation: "PC 20.04 lists several specific intents that elevate Kidnapping to Aggravated Kidnapping, a first-degree felony. These include holding for ransom, using as a hostage, or to facilitate another felony.",

                answer: "No, the fact that conduct is justified does not abolish or impair any remedy available in a civil suit.",
                explanation: "PC 9.06 makes it clear that criminal justification is separate from civil liability. While CPRC 83.001 later grants civil immunity for justified force, Chapter 9 itself does not.",
