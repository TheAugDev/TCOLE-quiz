This involves sending a formal written demand for the car's return by certified mail. Only after the renter fails to comply with this notice does it typically become a criminal Theft of Service case.</div></details>

            answer: "A presumption the property was known to be stolen",
            explanation: "For dealers buying used property over $25, the law presumes they knew the property was stolen if they fail to follow specific documentation procedures, which aids in prosecution.",

            answer: "To make a stolen vehicle appear legitimate for resale",
            explanation: "The main goal of a salvage switch is to give a stolen vehicle a new, seemingly clean identity using the VIN from a legally salvaged vehicle, making it easier to sell to an unsuspecting buyer.",

            answer: "Theft of Service (Class B)",
            explanation: "This involves securing a service (the meal) with the intent to avoid payment. The punishment follows the standard theft ladder, and a value of $90 falls into the Class C range ($<100). Wait, the value ladder for Class B is $100-$750. Let me re-check. Yes, Less than $100 is Class C. The question states $90. So the answer should be Theft of Service (Class C). Let me correct the options and answer. Ah, the prompt says the value is $90. The ladder is <$100 is Class C. $100 to <$750 is Class B. The value is $90. So it is Class C. Let me re-evaluate the provided quiz answers. The original quiz had no question like this. I will make one that is clear. Let's change the value to $150. A person eats a $150 meal and leaves. The offense is Theft of Service, and the value puts it in the Class B Misdemeanor category ($100 to <$750).",
