                answer: "Obtain proper identification and information about next of kin.",
                explanation: "If the victim is conscious, gathering identifying information and who to contact is a priority, as their condition could worsen. This is a key part of the preliminary investigation.",

            },
            {

                answer: "Circular",
                explanation: "The force of gravity pulling a drop straight down onto a flat surface results in a circular stain. As the angle of impact decreases, the stain becomes more elliptical.",

                answer: "True",
                explanation: "The knot and the ligature are critical pieces of evidence. Officers should wait for the Medical Examiner and cut the rope *above* the knot to preserve it for analysis.",
