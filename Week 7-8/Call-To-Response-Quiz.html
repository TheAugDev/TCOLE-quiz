                answer: "Avoid using sirens and lights unless there is imminent danger of serious bodily injury.",
                explanation: "A silent approach is often preferred for crimes in progress to avoid alerting the suspect, which could lead to a hostage situation or the destruction of evidence.",
                reference: "Handout Page 1 & 13: 'Avoid the use of sirens and lights unless there is imminent danger of serious bodily injury.'"

                question: "What is the legal difference between 'Open Fields' and 'Curtilage'?",
                options: ["There is no difference; police can search both without a warrant.", "'Open Fields' are protected by the 4th Amendment, while 'Curtilage' is not.", "'Curtilage' is the area immediately surrounding a dwelling and is protected, while 'Open Fields' are not.", "'Curtilage' refers to farmland, while 'Open Fields' refers to any undeveloped land."],
                answer: "'Curtilage' is the area immediately surrounding a dwelling and is protected, while 'Open Fields' are not.",
                explanation: "The Supreme Court has ruled that the 4th Amendment's protection of the home extends to its curtilage, but not to open fields where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy.",
                reference: "Handout Page 2: 'Open Fields: officers may enter and search open fields. Curtilage: area of open space surrounding a dwelling, immediately adjacent & considered part of the house.'"

                answer: "The time of day the observation is made.",
                explanation: "The four factors are: Distance, Fence Enclosure, Nature of Use, and Observation Protection. The time of day is not a factor in the legal definition of curtilage.",

                answer: "They had exigent circumstances, specifically to break up a violent fight.",
                explanation: "The Supreme Court ruled that the need to render emergency aid and prevent serious injury (exigent circumstances) outweighed the warrant requirement, justifying the entry.",
                reference: "Handout Page 3: 'Exigent circumstances such as breaking up a violent fight permit warrantless entry into dwelling without a warrant.'"

                answer: "Stand off to the side of the door, using the wall frame for potential cover.",
                explanation: "Standing directly in the 'fatal funnel' of a doorway exposes an officer to unnecessary risk. Standing to the side provides better cover and tactical advantage.",
                reference: "Handout Page 3: 'DO NOT STAND IN DOORWAYS & STAND AWAY FROM THE DOOR... Stand off to the side: framing & exterior walls may provide more cover.'"
            },

                question: "What is a 'Protective Sweep' as defined by *Maryland v. Buie*?",
                options: ["A full search of a house for evidence after an arrest.", "A quick and limited search of a premises, incident to an arrest, for people who may pose a threat.", "A search of a person for weapons.", "A sweep of the area for witnesses after a crime."],
                answer: "A quick and limited search of a premises, incident to an arrest, for people who may pose a threat.",
                explanation: "A protective sweep is not a search for evidence; it is a limited search for people based on reasonable suspicion that they pose a danger to officers.",
                reference: "Handout Page 4: 'Incident to a lawful arrest, a protective sweep of a premises is permitted provided it is supported by reasonable suspicion... The protective sweep is limited to areas where people could be hiding...'"

                answer: "The safety of people (officers, victims, public) first, then evidence.",
                explanation: "Life safety always takes precedence over evidence preservation. Officers must address any immediate threats or medical needs before focusing on the evidence.",

                answer: "The Medical Examiner or their authorized deputy.",

REMOVAL OF BODIES. ...the body shall not be disturbed or removed from the position in which it is found by any person without authorization from the medical examiner...'<br><a href='https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.49.htm#49.25' target='_blank' class='text-indigo-600 hover:underline'>Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 49.25</a>"

                question: "What is the purpose of separating witnesses at a crime scene before interviewing them?",
                options: ["To make the investigation go faster.", "To see who is more cooperative.", "To prevent them from influencing each other's stories.", "To keep them from leaving the scene."],
                answer: "To prevent them from influencing each other's stories.",
                explanation: "Separating witnesses helps ensure that each account is independent and not contaminated by what others have said, which is crucial for the integrity of the investigation.",

                answer: "To solicit information from persons in the immediate area who may have seen or heard something.",
                explanation: "A canvass is a systematic search for additional witnesses or information in the vicinity of the crime scene.",

                answer: "For any Class C misdemeanor not committed in the officer's view.",
                explanation: "Generally, warrantless arrests for misdemeanors require the offense to have occurred in the officer's presence, with specific statutory exceptions (like family violence or violation of a protective order).",
                reference: "Handout Page 10 & 14 & 26: Lists the 11 powers, none of which include a general power to arrest for a Class C not in view."

                question: "What did the Supreme Court rule in *Payton v. New York* regarding routine felony arrests?",

                answer: "Police must have an arrest warrant to enter a suspect's home to make a routine felony arrest, absent exigent circumstances.",
                explanation: "This landmark case established that the 4th Amendment draws a 'firm line at the entrance to the house' and that an arrest warrant is required to cross that line for a routine arrest.",
                reference: "Handout Page 11: 'absent exigent circumstances or an exception, the police may not enter a person's home to make an arrest without a warrant.'"

                answer: "A resident consents to the entry, or exigent circumstances exist.",
                explanation: "This statute codifies the ruling in *Payton v. New York*, explicitly limiting a warrantless entry for an arrest to situations involving consent or a recognized emergency.",

                question: "What is the significance of the ruling in *United States v. Santana*?",
                options: ["Police can never arrest someone standing in their doorway.", "A suspect may defeat a warrantless arrest that began in a public place by retreating into their home.", "A person standing in an open doorway is in a 'public place' and has no expectation of privacy.", "Police must get a warrant to speak to someone at their front door."],
                answer: "A person standing in an open doorway is in a 'public place' and has no expectation of privacy.",
                explanation: "The court ruled that Santana, standing in her open doorway, was exposed to public view and therefore could be arrested without a warrant when police had probable cause, and her retreat into the house constituted a 'hot pursuit'.",

                answer: "The area within the arrestee's immediate control or 'wing-span'.",
                explanation: "The justification for a search incident to arrest is to find weapons the arrestee might use or evidence they might destroy. This justification only extends to the area they can immediately reach.",
                reference: "Handout Page 14: 'Accessible home area immediately around an arrested person (wing-span area) may be searched.'"

                answer: "Police may temporarily seize a residence and prevent a person from entering while they obtain a search warrant.",
                explanation: "The Court found it was a reasonable seizure to secure the premises from the outside to prevent the destruction of evidence while a warrant was being sought, balancing law enforcement needs with privacy interests.",
                reference: "Handout Page 13: 'temporary seizure lawful if it is supported by probable cause, limited in nature, and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcement needs...'"

                answer: "An Arrest Warrant is issued before a case is filed, while a Capias is issued by a court with jurisdiction *after* a case is filed.",
                explanation: "A Capias is a writ from the court itself to bring a defendant before it, typically after indictment or failure to appear, whereas an arrest warrant is issued by a magistrate to initiate an arrest based on a probable cause affidavit.",

                answer: "Only for a felony warrant, and only after being refused admittance after giving notice of their authority and purpose.",
                explanation: "Forcible entry is a significant intrusion, and the law restricts its use to felony cases and requires officers to first knock and announce their identity and purpose.",

                options: ["The officer's personal comfort.", "The protection of the person, the officer, or another individual.", "Anytime a person is carrying a firearm.", "Only if the person has committed a crime."],
                answer: "The protection of the person, the officer, or another individual.",
                explanation: "This statute allows for temporary disarming based on a reasonable belief of a threat, prioritizing immediate safety for everyone involved in the contact.",
                reference: "Handout Page 11: CCP 14.03(h)(1) - 'officer reasonably believes it is necessary for the protection of the person, officer, or another individual.'<br><a href='https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.14.htm#14.03' target='_blank' class='text-indigo-600 hover:underline'>Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 14.03</a>"

                answer: "A limited pat-down of the outer clothing for weapons.",
                explanation: "A frisk is not a search for evidence. It is a protective measure based on reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous, and it is strictly limited in scope to what is necessary to find weapons.",

                answer: "A warrant shall be issued for their arrest.",
                explanation: "A summons is a less intrusive way to compel a court appearance, but failure to comply results in the issuance of a more forceful tool: the arrest warrant.",
                reference: "Handout Page 18: CCP 15.03(b) - 'If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons a warrant shall be issued.'<br><a href='https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.15.htm#15.03' target='_blank' class='text-indigo-600 hover:underline'>Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 15.03</a>"

                answer: "Name/description of the accused, Name of the offense, Signed by a magistrate.",
                explanation: "These three elements are essential for a warrant to be legally sufficient: it must identify who is to be arrested, what they are accused of, and that it comes from a proper legal authority.",
