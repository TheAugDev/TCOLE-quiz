                answer: "Tears in tissue with ragged, bruised edges caused by blunt force.",
                explanation: "Lacerations are caused by crushing or tearing force, which results in irregular wound edges, unlike the clean cut of an incised wound.",
                reference: "Handout Page 1: 'Lacerations are tears in tissue... Caused by direct blunt force, which cause tears in the skin that are ragged with bruised (contused) edges.'"

                options: ["The age of the victim.", "The time the blood was deposited.", "The angle of impact.", "The blood type of the individual."],
                answer: "The angle of impact.",
                explanation: "A blood drop striking a surface at a 90-degree angle is circular, while drops striking at steeper angles become more elongated or oval.",
                reference: "Handout Page 2: 'Angle of Impact: moves from round, to oval...'"

                options: ["Drip Stain", "Arterial Spurt", "Cast-off Pattern", "Impact Pattern"],
                answer: "Cast-off Pattern",
                explanation: "This pattern is typically created when a bloody object, like a weapon or a fist, is swung, flinging drops of blood onto a nearby surface.",
                reference: "Handout Page 3 & 4: 'Cast-off from Weapon' and 'Cast-off Pattern' definitions."

                answer: "A gunshot",
                explanation: "The extreme energy of a gunshot atomizes blood into a fine mist of very small droplets, characteristic of high velocity spatter.",
                reference: "Handout Page 3: 'High velocity (>100 f/s, 30 m/s): e.g. gunshot, machinery.'"
            },

                answer: "Blood that travels in the opposite direction of the bullet, back towards the weapon and shooter.",
                explanation: "Back-spatter is caused by gases from the muzzle blast forcing blood from the entrance wound backward, and it is only found at very close ranges.",
                reference: "Handout Page 3 & 4: 'Arises from entrance wound. Passes back towards weapon & shooter.'"

                question: "What is the 'Area of Convergence' in bloodstain pattern analysis?",
                options: ["The three-dimensional location of the blood source.", "The point where the victim and assailant first made contact.", "The two-dimensional location on a surface where lines drawn through the long axes of stains intersect.", "The location where the most blood is found."],
                answer: "The two-dimensional location on a surface where lines drawn through the long axes of stains intersect.",
                explanation: "By drawing lines through multiple bloodstains, investigators can pinpoint a two-dimensional area on a surface (like a wall or floor) from which the blood originated.",
                reference: "Handout Page 2 & 4: 'Point of Convergence' diagram and 'Area of Convergence' definition."

                answer: "The three-dimensional location in space from which the blood spatter originated.",
                explanation: "After determining the area of convergence (2D), investigators use the angle of impact of the stains to calculate the height, establishing the three-dimensional point in space where the impact occurred.",

                answer: "Conduct a visual exam without moving or altering the body.",
                explanation: "It is critical to preserve the body's position and any associated evidence. The officer's initial exam should be strictly visual to avoid contamination or disturbance.",

                question: "Why must a responding officer avoid using terms like 'SIDS' or 'SUID' at the scene of an infant death?",
                options: ["Because those terms are not medically accurate.", "Because they are medical diagnoses that can only be made after a complete and thorough investigation.", "Because it is against departmental policy.", "Because it can be upsetting to the parents."],
                answer: "Because they are medical diagnoses that can only be made after a complete and thorough investigation.",
                explanation: "Using these terms prematurely is a conclusion. The officer's role is to treat the scene as a potential homicide and investigate all possibilities, not to make a medical diagnosis.",
                reference: "Handout Page 5 & 8: 'Sudden Infant Death (SID): is a medical diagnosis, responding officer must not use this term at the scene.'"

                question: "An infant death occurring at over 6 months of age should be treated with what level of caution?",
                options: ["It is a typical SIDS case.", "It should bring suspicion of abuse.", "It is likely due to an undiagnosed medical condition.", "It requires no special investigation."],
                answer: "It should bring suspicion of abuse.",
                explanation: "The statistical model for SIDS shows that 90% of cases occur within 7 months, and deaths after 6 months are statistically less likely to be SIDS, thus warranting higher suspicion.",
                reference: "Handout Page 6: 'Any infant death > 6 months should bring suspicion of abuse. 12 months is too old for a SIDS death.'"

                question: "When collecting wet, bloody clothing at a crime scene, what is the proper packaging method?",
                options: ["Place it in a plastic bag to keep it moist.", "Place each item in its own paper bag.", "Roll all items together in a single large paper sheet.", "Leave it at the scene to air dry before collecting."],
                answer: "Place each item in its own paper bag.",
                explanation: "Paper bags are used because they allow the item to air dry, preventing the growth of mold and bacteria that would degrade biological evidence like DNA. Plastic bags trap moisture and destroy evidence.",
                reference: "Handout Page 8: 'Any wet items, such as clothing with blood on them should be placed in paper bags. Each piece of evidence should have its own paper bag.'"

                answer: "Contact wounds have torn and charred skin edges from the muzzle blast, while close-range wounds have smudging/tattooing.",
                explanation: "A contact wound involves the direct transfer of heat and gas into the skin, causing charring and tearing. A close-range wound has these gases and particles deposited *on* and *in* the skin.",
