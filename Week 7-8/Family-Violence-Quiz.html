                reference: "Handout Page 1: 'Note to the instructor: Students should be instructed to use the term \"family\" rather than \"domestic\" violence because Texas law defines and uses family violence and there is no legal definition for domestic violence.'"

                answer: "No, because the prior offense was outside the 12-month window.",
