Philosophy of Forfeiture 
TAKE THE PROFIT MOTIVE OUT OF CRIME!!!
 Should forfeiture be considered a form of “extra 
punishment?”
 Proportionality of property to be forfeited to the 
seriousness of the offense
 Jeopardy Issues
 Filing of criminal offense not 
necessary
 Not Guilty/Dismissal affects 
property
 CCP CH 59
 Forfeiture of Contraband
 CCP Art. 18.095. 
SEIZURE OF CIRCUIT BOARD OF GAMBLING DEVICE, EQUIPMENT, 
OR PARAPHERNALIA
 PROCEEDS VS INSTRUMENTALITIES
 Is property gained from the commission of the offense?
 Or
 Is property used to further the commission of the offense?
 11.2. Identify the philosophy behind forfeiture and the extent to which it is 
appropriate.  
Philosophy of forfeiture  
• Should forfeiture be a form of “extra punishment?”  
o Main goal is to deprive criminals of the profits and instrumentalities of crime in a 
manner that benefits law enforcement and the State.  
o Remedial, not punitive  
 8th Amendment, Excessive Fines Clause applies  
 Amount seized must bear some relationship to the gravity of the underlying offense  
o Not intended to be a means of oppression  
o Must seek justice  
• Proportionality of property to be forfeited to the seriousness of the offense

 WHAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR 
FORFEITURE?
 COMPREHENSIVE SCENARIO 1
 It is Monday morning at the Smiling Face grocery store, a “mom and 
pop” operation run by Mr. and Mrs. Benavidez. Every Monday for the 
last year, a man they know only as Cinco comes to the store. He has 
asked them to accept checks for payment of merchandise, but to tell 
the person writing the check to leave the “Pay To” portion blank and 
they will use the store stamp later when they deposit it. The thing is 
they do not have a store stamp. Cinco pays them 20% more than the 
total of the value of all the checks added up. While they think it is 
suspicious, the Benavidez’s see the extra money as bonus for their 
years of hard work and since they are paid in cash, they see no harm 
and no record of the action. In fact, the extra money, averaging 
about $500.00 a week, allowed them to buy their new SUV. When 
Cinco is arrested and charged with Money Laundering, the 
investigation leads to the Benavides.

altered gambling equipment, or gambling paraphernalia; 
(2) carry the circuit board before the magistrate; and 
(3) retain custody of the circuit board as the property seized pursuant to the warrant 
as required under this chapter.

crime or the person's representative or assignee receives from: (A) a movie, book, 
magazine article, tape recording, phonographic record, radio or television 
presentation, telephone service, electronic media format, including an Internet 
website, or live entertainment in which the crime was reenacted; or (B) the sale of 
tangible property the value of which is increased by the notoriety gained from the 
conviction of an offense by the person accused or convicted of the crime.

Angela is a stripper at a local club. One of her regular customers, 
Martin Jenkins, routinely spends $2,000.00 a week on private dances 
from her. He’s been doing this for more than a year. But this week he 
cut her off, so she phoned his supervisor to report him. It turns out, 
Jenkins works for the state as a commercial vehicle inspector at an 
international port of entry. The investigation finds he lives in a 
$400,000.00 home, has a set of matching Land Rovers for him and his 
wife, matching motorcycles for him and his wife, lavish furnishings, a 
gun collection with more than 100 weapons and has paid cash for 
everything. His annual salary is $51,000.00 and his wife, who works as a 
part-time crossing guard for the school district makes about $8,000.00. 
The investigation determines he is linked to a sophisticated narcotic 
smuggling operation and his part is to distract inspectors while the 
drugs are moved through the port.

 Tiny Tub Motors has been in the business of selling used cars for ten 
years. The business is on a leased property located in a rundown 
part of town in what used to be a gas station. The lot has a display

Information 
Your Affiant has been able to conduct surveillance digitally on the target 
through social media application as well as conduct visual surveillance on the 
target. Target has advertised multiple times that they had marijuana and THC 
disposables for sale. Affiant has also conducted multiple controlled buys 
utilizing a confidential informant (CI) who was able to contact the target and set 
up purchases of cocaine, marijuana, psilocybin, and THC products. 
Investigation 
Your Affiant was made aware of a person manufacturing or delivering a 
controlled substance in penalty group 1 (cocaine) during the month of February 
2025. The target was later positively identified as Jose Manuel Bernal (HIM 
01/27/2006) by TX DL. I spoke with a confidential informant (CI) who was able 
to contact the Bernal through social media to set up a controlled buy of cocaine 
for a predetermined amount of US Currency. 
From February 2025 to April of 2025 multiple controlled buys were conducted 
with the CI and Bernal. On every occasion the CI was able to exchange a 
predetermined amount of US Currency for narcotics including cocaine, 
psilocybin, marijuana and THC disposable vapes. During all controlled buys a 
felony amount of either cocaine or THC was purchased. During the Investigation, 
your affiant has been able to monitor Bernal's social media where he advertises 
the sale of Marijuana, Psilocybin and THC disposables. Bernal was observed 
posting products for sale often. 
On two occasions during controlled buys affiant observed a grey Dodge Charger 
TX LP WBS3471 arrive on scene and meet with the CI. The driver of the 
vehicle on both occasions was found to be Bernal. The registered owner of the 
Dodge Charger TX DL WBS3471 was found to be Jose Manuel Bernal. During 
another controlled buy affiant observed another vehicle, a blue Infinity 4 door 
sedan, arrive on scene with Bernal as the passenger. 
Investigators with the Denton Police Department were able to locate the Dodge 
Charger parked in the driveway of 402 E State Highway 121 #48, Lewisville, 
Denton County, Texas. The vehicle showed to have scanned at that location 
multiple times by various license plate reader devices. Investigators conducted 
surveillance at this location and observed Bernal coming and going from the 
location and leaving in the Dodge Charger. 
Affiant conducted surveillance at the location after Bernal advertised on his 
social media that he was open and to send orders and addresses. Affiant observed 
Bernal exit the residence and then get into the Infinity sedan which picked him 
up. Affiant was conducting surveillance on another target in March. This target 
was followed to Lewisville where they were observed meeting with Bernal at a 
gas station near his residence. Bernal was in the Dodge Charger.
