 A conviction under 483 may be obtained on the 
uncorroborated testimony of a party to the offense
CCP 38.14: Testimony of Accomplice
 NO convictions upon accomplice testimony unless 
corroborated by other evidence tending to connect
 AND the corroboration is NOT sufficient if it merely 
shows the commission of the offense
Sec. 483.072. UNCORROBORATED TESTIMONY. A conviction under this 
chapter may be obtained on the uncorroborated testimony of a party to 
the offense.
(a) NO convictions for HSC 481 offenses on a person’s testimony 
who is NOT a licensed peace officer or special investigator but

◦ the testimony is corroborated by other evidence tending to connect 
the defendant with the offense committed.
(b) Corroboration is not sufficient it only shows the 
commission of the offense.
The “tends to connect” standard courts have found sufficient to 
corroborate accomplice testimony under Art. 38.14 also applies to this 
article. When weighing the sufficiency of corroborating evidence under Art. 
38.141(a) , a reviewing court must exclude the testimony of the covert 
agent from consideration and examine the remaining evidence to 
determine whether there is evidence that tends to connect the defendant 
to the commission of the offense. The corroborating evidence by itself 
need not prove the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, 
the evidence must simply link the accused in some way to the commission 
of the crime and show rational jurors could conclude that this evidence 
sufficiently tended to connect the accused to the offense.

enforcement unless the testimony is corroborated by other evidence 
tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed.
(b) Corroboration is not sufficient for the purposes of this article if the 
corroboration only shows the commission of the offense.
