# Final QA Report — index.html (TCOLE-quiz)

Date: 2025-10-03

Summary
-------
- Objective: Consolidate and QA `index.html` so every week folder's topic pages and quizzes are reachable from the corresponding week tab, remove duplicated links across Quick Access / All Quizzes, and verify all hrefs map to actual files.
- Outcome: All planned edits applied. Every file in `Week 5-6`, `Week 7-8`, `Week 9-10`, `Week 11-12`, and `Week 14-16` is referenced inside its corresponding week tab in `index.html`. All hrefs resolved to existing files.

What I changed (high level)
---------------------------
- Added missing week tab content blocks for:
  - `Week 7-8` (inserted study topic cards + practice quizzes for that folder)
  - `Week 14-16` (nav tab + tab-content linking all files in `Week 14-16/`)
- Moved quizzes so they live inside their week tabs (not duplicated site-wide). Notably Week 11-12 quizzes were placed under `#week11-12` → Practice Quizzes.
- Removed duplicate week-specific cards from:
  - Quick Access (kept only intentionally curated cross-week/centralized links)
  - All Quizzes (trimmed to centralized cross-week quiz(s) only)
- Deleted the temporary `mainpage.html` earlier per instruction (done in previous step).

Verification performed
---------------------
- Per-week in-tab check (PowerShell): iterated files in each Week folder and confirmed each file has a matching `href="Week X-Y/<file>"` inside `index.html`.
  - Result: OK_IN_TAB for every file in Week 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 14-16.
- Href → file existence check (PowerShell): extracted all unique hrefs pointing at `Week .../...` in `index.html` and verified each path exists on disk.
  - Result: OK for every referenced href (no MISSING entries).

Exact verification logs are present in the terminal history; key result — NO MISSING links.

Removed duplicates / de-duplication notes
--------------------------------------
- Quick Access: removed week-specific topic/quiz cards that duplicated the canonical week tabs. Kept only centralized cross-week items intended for fast access.
  - Examples removed: (Crimes-Against-Persons, Arrest-Search-Seizure) — these are now only accessible from their week tab.
- All Quizzes: trimmed to keep only truly cross-week/centralized quiz(s) (Centralized Practice Quiz). Week-specific quizzes were removed from that list and remain in their week tabs.

Risks and edge-cases covered
---------------------------
- Case-sensitive filenames: verification used exact path tests; if files are renamed locally later, links will break. Recommendation: keep filenames stable or adopt a small generator.
- Filenames with spaces or unusual characters (e.g., `Robbery -Death-Related-Offenses.html`) are linked and verified as-is; consider normalizing filenames to avoid cross-platform issues.

Recommendations / Next steps
---------------------------
1. (Optional) Add a small generator script (PowerShell or Node.js) that auto-builds the week tab markup from the folder contents. That prevents human drift when files are added/removed. I can implement this for you.
2. Preview the site in a browser locally to visually confirm layout and that tabs behave as expected.
3. Normalize filenames (optional) to remove spaces/odd characters to improve portability.

Files changed
-------------
- `index.html` — week tab additions and duplicate removals (multiple edits during this session).
- `mainpage.html` — temporary prototype removed earlier (not present now).
- `FINAL_QA_REPORT.md` — this file (added).

Status of QA todo list
----------------------
- Finish Quick Access QA: completed
- Trim All Quizzes: completed
- Verify Week Tabs: completed
- Link-to-File Verification: completed
- Final QA Report: completed (this file)

If you want, I can now implement the generator script (PowerShell or Node.js) that reads each `Week X-Y/` folder and regenerates the `index.html` week-content blocks. That will keep `index.html` in sync automatically. Tell me which language you prefer and I'll scaffold it.
